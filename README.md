# CardiacSegNet Backend

CardiacSegNet Backend is a robust server-side application designed to handle the processing and analysis of cardiac MRI images. It provides RESTful APIs for managing image data, performing segmentation tasks, and facilitating communication with the frontend interface.

## Features

- **Image Processing:** Efficient handling and processing of cardiac MRI images.
- **Segmentation Services:** Implementation of advanced algorithms for accurate cardiac image segmentation.
- **API Endpoints:** Well-defined RESTful APIs for seamless integration with frontend applications.
- **Data Management:** Secure storage and retrieval of imaging data.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fahad-git/cardiacsegnet-backend.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd cardiacsegnet-backend
   ```

3. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To start the development server:

```bash
python main.py
```

The server will start, and the API endpoints will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /images:** Retrieve a list of all cardiac MRI images.
- **POST /images:** Upload a new cardiac MRI image.
- **GET /images/{id}:** Retrieve a specific image by ID.
- **PUT /images/{id}:** Update details of a specific image.
- **DELETE /images/{id}:** Delete a specific image.
- **POST /segment:** Perform segmentation on a provided cardiac MRI image.

For detailed documentation of each endpoint, refer to the API documentation available at `http://localhost:8000/docs` once the server is running.

## Testing

To run the test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

Ensure all tests pass before deploying or contributing to the project.
